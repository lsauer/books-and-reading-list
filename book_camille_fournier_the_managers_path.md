The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier: Best lines

**On the value of planning:**  

- *The value of planning ultimately is not that you execute the plan perfectly and catch every detail beforehand, 
it is that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens.*


**On the value of explaining:**  

- *I never hesitate to take the opportunity to explain basics and motivation to a senior or a junior member. 
It educates them without making them feel small, they learn to trust my judgement, and advice and we bring about change.
Taking the time to explain is very important.*


**On the value of agility:**  

<blockquote>
The agile manifesto:

-   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

-   Working software over comprehensive documentation

-   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

-   Responding to change over following a plan
</blockquote>

**On the value of automation:**  

- *If you find yourself playing the role of task-master, criticizing people who break the rules, 
see if the process itself can be changed to be easier to follow. 
It's a waste of your time to play rules cop and automation can often make the rules more obvious.*


**On the ingredients of a successful leader:**  

- *Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak.
They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge and the knowledge of their team.
Now is a great time to practice your writing and speaking skills. Write design documents and get feedback on them from 
better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. 
Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.*


**On the value of rephrasing:**  

- *Learn how to hear what someone says and rephrase it in your own words.*

**On managing people:**  

<blockquote>
The main tasks required to manage people:

-   Taking on new reports

-   Holding regular I-Is (one-on-one's)

-   Giving feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement and praise as warranted

-   Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring
</blockquote>


**On onboarding people and asking the right questions:**  

<blockquote>
Key questions:

-   What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback (writing, or less formal and verbal feedback)

-   Why did you decide to work here?

-   How do I know when you are annoyed or that I picked you in a bad time?

-   Are there some things that make you annoyed?

-   Do you have clear career goals, and can I help you archive them?

-   Any surprises since you have joined, good or bad, that I should know about?
</blockquote>

- *Create onboarding documentation / wiki and let the newcomers edit them whilst they are learning.*

**On doing one-on-ones:**  

- *Whatever type of I-I you do, leave room to get to know the person reporting to you as a human being. 
Show that you care about them as individuals. Let them talk about their family, friends, hobbies, pets.
Get to know their career so far and ask them about their long-term career goals. 
It doesn't have to just be a focus on the next skill or promotion. 
Show that you are invested in helping them now and in the future.*

- *For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways and to-do's from your I-Is. 
This helps you keep context about what has happened, and is useful for remembering when and what feedback was given.*

**On micromanagers vs delegators:**  

- *The micromanager ultimately never gives up control and undermines the next-in-line, while the effective delegator makes
it clear to the next-in-line what the goals are and what the responsibilities are, and provides support and
guidance to help the next-in-line succeed.*

- *The hardest thing about micromanagement is that there are times when you need to do it.
Junior engineers often thrive under detailed oversight because they want that specific direction.*

- *The worst micromanagers are the ones that constantly ask for information they could easily get themselves.*

**Key message to drive home:**  

- *When you strip creative and talented people of their autonomy, they lose motivation very quickly.*

- *Being a good leader, means being good at delegating.*


**On establishing standards for code and systems:** 

- *I develop some guidelines to help me feel better about the structure around some issues.* 

**On the matter of trust:**  

- *If you do not figure out how to let go of details, delegate and trust your team you are likely to suffer personally.*
