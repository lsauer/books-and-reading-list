*Author: Camille Fournier*

## Chapter 4 Summary: Managing People

You have progressed to the level where people trust you to manage other humans

- Figure out your managing style
- Your technical role will be changing
- The team is only as healthy as its individuals

**Main tasks to manage people**

- Taking on a new mentee or report (a new &quot;subordinate&quot;)
- Holding regular 1-1s (one-on-ones)
- Give feedback on career growth, progression towards goals
- Working with the mentee to help the team members grow

<blockquote>
As you go through your management career you will repeatedly experience having someone new to start to report to.
</blockquote>

**Key question to ask your charges:**  

- How do you like to be praised? (e.g. in public or private)
- Why did you decide to work here?
- What excites you professionally?
- How to I sense when you are in a bad mood?
- Are there things that put you off?
- Any manger behaviors that you particularly dislike?
- Do you have a clear career goal that I can help you archive?

<blockquote>
Create a 30 day, 60 day, 90 day plan, which are realistic milestones that ensure measurability and transparency. You should identify fast if someone is a mishire.
</blockquote>

**Set basic goals that are expected from your subordinates like:**

- Getting up to speed
- Code bug fixing
- Performing releases
- Let the newbies contribute to onboarding documentation
- Create a set of onboarding documents that are edited by every new hire

**Get a clear outline of your mentee:**

- Communicate your style and expectations to the new hires
- The new hire needs to know what you expect of him
- Get feedback from your new hire
- Get the perspective of the new mentee on the team within the first 90 days



**Communicate with your team and have regular 1-1s**

<blockquote>
&quot;Regular 1-1s are like oil changes, if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time&quot; - Marc Hedlund
</blockquote>

**On scheduling 1-1s:**

- Default is weekly (this gives you room for the occasional missed week.)
- Meeting less frequently means scheduling 101s which is a drag
- Set them outside of their productive workflow hours

Scheduling factors to take into consideration:

- How often do you interact with the person offhand during the week?
- How much coaching does this person really need?
- How much does this person push information up to you?
- How good is your relationship with this person?
- How stable are things in the team or the company?

**The common 1-1s Styles:**

- The To-Do List Meeting
  - Parties come in with a list of objectives to cover in order of importance
  - Updates are given from both sides, decisions are moade or discussed, planning happens.
  - A very professional and efficient if not even cold style. It forces your reports to think beforehand about the meeting and what they might want to discuss.

- The catch up
  - A more fluid style, where the goal is to first listen to anything the direct report wants to discuss.
  - The meeting should be driven by them.
  - It&#39;s more of a rambling 1-1 which can be left unchecked and turn into a complaining session or therapy.
  - Empathetic leaders can get sucked into an unhealthy closeness with their direct reports.

- The feedback meeting
  - When 1-1s are devoted to informal feedback and coaching
  - Hold these kind of meetings at a regular interval
  - Quarterly is frequent enough
  - If you have an employee with performance issues, feedback meetings should happen more frequently.

**On firing someone:**

- If you are about to fire someone, document the feedback meetings to have measurability and transparency.
- Send the expectations in writing like email.
- In case of something that requires corrective feedback  (insulting a colleague, missing a critical meeting, using inappropriate language) do not wait for a 1-1. The same goes for praise

**On progress reporting**

- Only when you are managing managers.
- When you are managing individuals only do 1-1s for progress reporting when you have someone who is off on a side project you are not personally overseeing.
- Take people who do not have anything else to say as a sign to meet less frequently

**General Pointers**

- Get to know the hires as a human person.
- Mix up the 1-1 style. It can be walking meetings or over coffee or lunch or anything else to get out o the office
- Try to keep notes in a shared document with you as the manager doing the note taking
- For every person maintain a shared document of notes

**The Good Manager, the Bad Manager, the Micromanager and the Delegator**

- Trust and control are the main issues around micromanagement.
- Give them autonomy
- The ability to have control over some part of your work is an important element of motivation. This is why micromanagers will have a difficult time retaining great teams
- Delegation is not the same as abdication
- You are still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed

**Advice**

- Gather your own information from the systems and technology before pestering your own team members, for information that is easy to retrieve by yourself
- Adjust your focus depending on the stage of the projects: like the frequency of standup meetings
- Use your team&#39;s goals to understand which details you should dig into
- If your team is making good on its goals and promises, the systems are stable and the product manager is happy, it is not necessary to dig into the details beyond a cursory overview.
- If the team is underperforming create lay down metrics that can be measured. What are you holding them accountable for?

**Establish standards for code and systems**

- Treat the open sharing of information, good or band in a neutral to positive way
- In the long run if you don&#39;t figure out how to let go of details, delegate and trust your team, you are likely going to suffer personally

<blockquote>

Your time is too valuable to waste, and your team deserves a manager who is willing to trust them to do things on their own.
</blockquote>



**Create a culture of continuous feedback**

- reports start with continuous feedback
- It is a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback
- It is training you to pay attention to individuals, which in turn makes it easier to identify and foster talent

Steps:

1. Know your people
  1. What are their strengths and weaknesses
  2. Get a baseline of each individual you are managing
2. Observe your people
  1. You cannot give feedback if you aren&#39;t paying attention
3. Provide lightweight regular feedback
  1. Start with positive feedback, it is easier and more fun to give
  2. Use a habit of constant feedback to correct things that do not go so well over time
4. Bonus: provide coaching
  1. Ask people what the might have done differently
  2. But coaching is not always a core need to do the job well
  3. Many times you will not have the qualifications or capability to provide the coaching that everyone on your team needs
  4. Most will be content with doing the job they know how to do well
  5. When they are doing it well it is a waste of time to try to coach them

**Performance reviews**

- The 360 model is a performance review that includes feedback in addition to a person&#39;s manager, his teammates and anyone who reports to him.
- Performance reviews synthesize a bunch of information about a person
- The self reviews give you a sense about what a person thinks about himself
- Writing a performance review gives you a chance to focus longer on an individual, but a performance review can often go wrong by focusing on too much bias

**Advice:**

- Give yourself enough time. It cannot be done in an hour
- Take notes regularly and collect reviews early on
- Companies have either open or closed feedback processes. You should always read the feedback
- Try to account for the whole year not just the past couple of months. That is why emails, Slack or other tools help, but it takes time to sift through the records. Taking notes early makes it easier
- Use concrete examples and excerpts from peer reviews.
- Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths:
  - Celebrate achievements and praise good work.
  - Those strengths should be used to determine who gets promoted, so take care of writing them down and reflect upon them
- Areas for improvement notes are tricky. Here are points of regular noticeable patterns:
  - People who struggle with saying no to distractions and help out instead of finishing their own projects
  - People that do good work but are have a knack for an overly critical or rude attitude
  - Who struggle to break their work up and balance planning to get things done
  - Who work well with other engineers but not across teams or departments
  - Who struggle to follow the accepted best practices
- The case that you have very little meaningful feedback for improvement indicates someone considerable for a promotion or more challenging work

**Avoid big surprises**

- If someone is underperforming this performance review should not be the first instance in which the person hears so
- If someone has just been promoted, raise the bar for the performance that is expected

**Finishing the review**

- Give out a printed copy of the notes that are discussed, to give them a chance to read the notes at home or at their workstation
- Many people are uncomfortable being praised for a lengthy amount of time
- Some reviews are scaled in ranking, such as 1-5, or in an ordinal system from fails to meets expectations, to exceeds expectations. This is though.

**Ask the CTO**

- Real potential reveals itself fairly quick. It shows itself as working hard, and going that extra mile, offering insightful suggestions on problems and helping the teams in areas that were previously neglected.
- Move the person to a place where it potential can be realized if the person is underperforming and unhappy.
- Don&#39;t confuse potential with school. You are not molding young minds. Potential is tied to actions and value produced - even if it is not the value you expected to see produced.
- The sooner you can get over the disappointment that a high potential person didn&#39;t work out, the sooner you can focus on the real stars on your team.



**Cultivating careers**

- The VP position is a critical leap. it is a clear sign that a person has grown into a critical asses at the company with a long term future and getting that promotion is a complex process.
- As a manager you often not only will be deciding who gets promoted and who doesn&#39;t, but rather a panel or committee will decide, so you have to make a case for the person you see as promising.
- In order to have your members continuously get promoted you need to make sure they know how to estimate their own work and deliver their work within the time estimates and of course that they learning from their own mistakes.

**Getting promoted**

Your aim is to learn how the game is played at the company. Every company is different in that aspect.

- Are there limits to how many promotions that happen per year?
- When do they generally happen?
- Which positions are open?

As you play the game you should be fairly straightforward with your team: keep an eye out for team members to stretch themselves and deliver the best aiming for a promotion

**Firing underperformers**

- It is often dictated by HR, even at small companies.You have a procedure and process to follow.
- Write the person a _performance improvement plan_. This is a set of clearly defined objectives that the person must meet within a fixed period of time.
- If the person delivers the person is taken off the plan, and otherwise fired.
- Coaching the person should have started long before the document is set up, informing that person that &quot;You are not doing X, Y, Z and you should do more of things ABC&quot;.
- Make clear how the person is failing expectations and give the person clear deliverables
- You will hear excuses and some are credible and should be taken into account.
- You need a record of negative feedback for the firing process
- Set a timeline of improvement options, and set them in writing. this also protects legally.
- Do not put anyone on the plan. Employees see this as a warning sign and leave as quickly as possible.
- Let the employee go happily and with goodwill with an attitude of: Former couples who break up can still remain friends
